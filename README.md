## The Project

In the third achievement of this course, I used the UI framework React to create the front-end of the app which I had created in the previous project. Previously, I had created a Node database from scratch, but the UI to access it was rudimentary. This project thus aimed at expanding open the previous one, by creating a fully functional, user friendly single page application (SPA) which displays a list of movies and details about each movie when clicked. The app also allows users to add and remove movies from a favorite list, update their user profile, see what movies are similar to the ones they viewed, and more.

The first part of the project involved creating the separate react components for each required function of the application. I learned how to create and use react state, props & effects to manipulate and display the data under specific circumstances by accessing the virtual DOM. Seven separate components were thus created, which all interact and depend on each other to function correctly. 

I then used react forms to allow users to register, login, and update their profiles. This was initially done with simple react components, but to make the application more user-friendly and aesthetic, react bootstrap was used. Client-side routing was then implemented, allowing the browser to respond to the changes in the virtual DOM. Finally, I learned about Redux and deployed the app online using Netlify.

## Challenges Faced

The most challenging aspect of this achievement was creating components without guidance from the course. Throughout most of this achievement, the course would walk us through the creation and writing of the components created, and if I followed the instructions and syntax correctly things worked fine. However, at the end of exercise 3.7, I had to create a Profile View component without any assistance. This proved to be hugely challenging. Until then, I had a basic understanding of what was going when creating components, using state, making api calls, etc.; but to implement this knowledge and create something by myself was a different matter. At this later stage aswell, the app and the various states of the data had become quite complex, adding to the difficulty.
